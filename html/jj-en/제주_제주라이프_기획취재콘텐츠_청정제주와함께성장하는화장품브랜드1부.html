                                        As Jeju has gained attention as a repository of cosmetics ingredients, the popularity of cosmetics products originating from Jeju has surged. Big cosmetics brands, such as Innisfree and Beyond, excitedly launched products using ingredients from Jeju. Made-in-Jeju cosmetics brands are also doing well. Jejuindi, that cultivates plants in Jeju for all its ingredients, and Accoje, that has a skincare line using various plants from Jeju such as echinacea and eleuthero, are two companies that have been actively using ingredients grown in Jeju and combining them with their brand story, expanding their presence to consumers from home and abroad as well as to visitors. As cosmetics ingredients from Jeju became more and more popular, a Korean original development manufacturer (ODM) company moved to Jeju with the purpose of finding and developing new ingredients to help lay a foundation for the further growth of the Jeju cosmetics ingredient industry as well as for the overall Jeju cosmetics industry.

                                        The story of Innisfree, a cosmetics brand focused on naturalism (the practice of focusing on natural ingredients), and Jeju goes back several decades. The late Suh Sung-hwan, the founder of Amore Pacific, cultivated a green tea field on Jeju island, the best location for tea farming, with a commitment to “revive the traditional tea culture of Korea.”

                                        Green tea leaves grown from the field cultivated by Amore Pacific were soon being brewed again as tea. The company studied green tea for several decades, discovered the possible use of green tea as a cosmetics ingredient, and finally made cosmetics with green tea. After launching Innisfree, Korea’s first cosmetics brand based on naturalism, the company’s “Green Tea Balancing Line” which uses Jeju green tea became a big hit and transformed the company into the leading cosmetics brand in Korea.

                                        Starting with the Green Tea Balancing Line, Innisfree presented a total of fifteen lines that used ingredients grown in Jeju, such as volcanic clusters, cymbidium orchids, bija, camellia, canola honey, cherry blossoms, and hallabong. Whenever Innisfree launched a new product using a natural ingredient from Jeju, the ingredient came to the spotlight. Some ingredients—like cymbidium orchids, bija, camellia, volcanic clusters, and lava seawater—that already existed on Jeju but were unknown to the public are now well-known for their function and beauty together with the Innisfree brand. This was possible because there were efforts to study the unique environment of Jeju Island, explore effective ingredients for skin based on literature reviews, and develop the values and stories of ingredients differentiated from the mainland.

                                        Based on tales saying that a whale eats sea mustard after giving birth, we introduced the effects of Jeju sea mustard. To highlight the regenerative energy of extracts of Jeju sea mustard and gulfweed from the clean Jeju sea, which is the core ingredient of Wrinkle Spot Essence, in our campaign we tell the story that ‘It is said that when a whale gives birth, that year will have a bad harvest of sea mustard.’ This highlights the regenerative power and purification functions from these sea plants.

The brand captured the hearts of Chinese tourists, known as youker, by combining clean ingredients from Jeju and the image of Jeju as a favorite tourist destination of the Chinese people. In 2012 when Innisfree first entered the Chinese market, sales reached KRW 229.4 billion and operating earnings reached KRW 36.3 billion, which were up 63% and 93% YoY respectively. Since then, sales and operating earnings have continuously increased over 30% and 50% respectively.
