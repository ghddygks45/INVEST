In 2019, Korea was selected as the 5th country to host Fjallraven Classic. Fjallraven Classic Korea was held from October 9 to 12, 2019 (1st round: October 9 to 11 / 2nd round: October 10 to 12), in Jeju. The event was joined by 400 trekkers (300 from Korea and 100 from overseas), who walked the event’s 60 km trekking course. The extensive course consisted of the following sections: Day 1: Eorimok – Witseoreum – Donnaeko (Donnaeko Wonang Campsite); Day 2: Donnaeko – Dongbaekgil – Muobeomjeongsa (Hawonmaeul Campsite); and Day 3: Muobeomjeongsa – Doloreumgil – Cheonasupgil – Hebron Hill Resort (Finish).</div>

                                        Each year, more than 200 Korean trekkers participate in Fjallraven Classic Sweden. More than half of trekkers who joined the Hong Kong event were Koreans, and around 50 Koreans joined the Denmark event. The total number of participants is more amazing. Korea ranked fifth in the Sweden event, third in Denmark, and first in Hong Kong. Korean trekkers were that much passionate about the event, which more than justified holding the event in Korea. We held a fox trekking event ) in Jeju in 2018. The event was joined by Sweden representatives. They must have felt the passion of Korean trekkers. In 2019, we officially launched Fjallraven Classic Korea in Jeju.

The Day 2 and Day 3 courses consisted of beautiful forest trails around the mountain, which were easier than the Day 1 course. Participants enjoyed the therapeutic atmosphere of the cool forest trails.

                                    <div class="normal-txt">Moreover, the company explains the Fjallraven Classic rules multiple times before the event, which most participants are believed to understand and accept. For first-timers in trekking and backpacking, the event itself is an opportunity to understand trekking etiquette and develop a mindset that cares for nature. Thus, during the Classic event, Fjallraven ensures that both organizers and participants protect and care for nature through self-supervision, believing that such would promote the sustainable enjoyment of nature. </div>
