Three tournaments have been held in Jeju so far, with astounding outcomes. In the first 3 years, 35,000, 41,000 and 46,000 galleries, respectively, visited the golf course where the tournament was held, which boosted Jeju’s economy. According to a research firm’s survey released by the CJ Group, in 2018, an average gallery visiting the golf course spent KRW 170,000 per day. The total direct effect of the CJ Cup in 2018 is estimated at KRW 24.9 billion. The tournament was also aired in 23 languages and watched by a billion households across 226 countries. Its media exposure alone is estimated to be worth KRW 184 billion.</div>
                                    <div class="normal-txt normal-mt2">The CJ Group also created promotional videos with PGA golfers in collaboration with the Jeju Tourism Organization. The video features PGA golfers enjoying Jeju’s specialties and natural environments. In the 2017 video, Adam Scott surfed on a Jeju beach and Jason Day was treated to Jeju’s local specialties: seafood caught by haenyeos and roasted black pigs. In 2018, Danny Willett climbed an Oreum to enjoy the beautiful landscape not found elsewhere in the world. The video of Brooks Koepka catching a 51 cm yellow porgy on the sea off the Jeju shores went viral on social media, especially among golf fans around the world. </div>
                                    <div class="normal-txt normal-mt2">In 2019, the globally released video showed Phil Mickelson and Choi Kyung-ju, two top players from the United States and Korea, respectively, enjoying the tea leaf field and horseback riding in Jeju. By showing renowned golfers candidly enjoying Jeju and having a great time, the video introduced the island’s charm to the world.</div>

                                    <div class="normal-txt normal-mt2">The CJ Cup is held at Club Nine Bridges, a golf course widely praised for achieving perfect harmony with nature. The course accentuates the characteristics of Jeju’s nature and allows for different options depending on the golfer’s skill level. In addition, Jeju’s strong whirlwinds that baffled even PGA golfers, Hallasan Break, ) and the superb scenery of the surrounding nature serve as key points for the promotion of Jeju on the global stage.</div>
                                    <div class="normal-txt">Club Nine Bridges is a world-class golf course. In the golf magazine Golf Digest, which announces a list of the world’s top golf courses every 2 years, Club Nine Bridges ranked 23rd in 2018 and 18th in 2020. Moreover, the course won the Best Golf Course title in Korea for 6 consecutive years (as of 2019) and was inducted in the Korean Golf Hall of Fame in 2017. In 2018, the golf course hosted an LPGA tournament for the first time in Korea, along with other prestigious international events, including the World Club Championship.</div>

In most cases, building a golf course in Korea means tearing down mountains and destroying nature in the area to a grave extent. However, in Jeju, the CJ Group was able to minimize damage to nature while building a world-class golf course. </div>
                                    <div class="quotes-box">
                                        Jeju’s climate is perfect for golfing all year round. In the island, you can feel various changes in nature. These factors make Jeju a perfect site for golf tourism. Jeju also offers a wide selection of spectacles, activities, and foods. I believe that Jeju’s image as a pollution-free region supported by the local government’s ecofriendly policies will improve the island’s chance of successfully developing its golf and tourism industries.
