                                    Industrialization has made the lives of human beings more prosperous, but along with it has come environmental degradation and the depletion of resources. Whenever natural disasters driven by extreme weather have occurred, people have said that the Earth was sick. This is proof of the recognition among some people of the severity of the situation and the necessity for countermeasures. Economic growth driven by indiscriminate development is no longer considered a virtue, while two key words—sustainability and coexistence—have become the foundation for advancement.

                                    Since the agreement on the Climate Change Convention was finally reached at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit in 1992, the global initiative for reducing greenhouse gas emissions has been put into action. In 2020, the Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015, enters into full force and 195 countries, including South Korea, will be obliged to reduce their GHG emissions. In line with the global trend of the new climate regime, Jeju Island has aggressively pushed ahead with the Jeju Carbon-Free Island 2030 (hereinafter referred to as “CFI 2030”) initiative. This is part of the island’s bold and preemptive set of measures for shifting towards an eco-friendly industrial structure as required by the era of climate change, while at the same time for securing stable growth and emerging as a global hub driving green industries.

                                    The beginning of the CFI 2030 initiative dates back to 2008. At the time, during which  global oil prices had reached over $100 a barrel, Jeju Island announced a mid- and long-term plan titled “Carbon-Free Island” aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving energy self-reliance by promoting its unique energy conservation policy and using the island’s own renewable energy sources. In May 2012, the plan drew global attention after it was further refined and announced as a comprehensive low-carbon, green-growth model and named the “Carbon-Free Island Jeju by 2030” initiative. It has since become one of the island’s most fundamental policies.

                                    The CFI 2030 vision consists of three key words: cleanliness, stability, and growth. The vision is to achieve a natural environment free of pollutants and establish a harmonious clean energy system; to build a stable energy supply system which allows for energy self-reliance and optimization, and reduced consumption; and to create an indigenous ecosystem for innovative energy industries. This illustrates the island’s commitment to securing energy stability and self-reliance as well as to joining international efforts towards adopting the new climate regime, which will help create and nurture an industrial ecosystem beneficial for Jeju residents and strengthen its unique energy industrial structure.
