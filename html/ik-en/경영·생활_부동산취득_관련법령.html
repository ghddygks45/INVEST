						<div class="top-info">Real estate acquired by foreigners in Korea is governed by the Act on Report of Real Estate Transactions, Etc., the Foreign Investment Promotion Act, the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, etc. With the exception of certain land requiring government permission, a foreigner may acquire real estate in Korea only by reporting and foreigners are not discriminated against in terms of procedure or regulations regarding acquisition. In principle, the acquisition procedure includes a contract, payment, report and registration. In cases of foreign-invested companies acquiring real estate in Korea, the procedure differs from that of other types of foreigners in that the notification of foreign investment and registration of a foreign-invested company precedes the contract. The payable amount for the acquisition of real estate after due process can be freely remitted overseas. Taxes on the acquisition of real estate include the acquisition tax, property tax, and the comprehensive real estate tax.</div>
