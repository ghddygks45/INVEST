												The reason why the hoarding phenomenon, which was caused by the COVID-19 crisis in most
												countries, has not occurred in Korea is due to the soundness of its domestic supply chain.
												The domestic supply chain, from sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, to sales, was unshakable
												even in these times of crisis
												.
												Most daily necessities are produced in Korea. Numerous online and offline stores, the world's
												strongest delivery system, consumers who have experienced crises several times, and a sourcing
												network spread across the globe are defining characteristics of Korea’s supply chain.
											</div>
											<div class="normal-txt">
												As a result, a relatively stable level of retail sales was maintained in 2020 and drove
												production.
												The total retail sales index recorded 115.2 in February 2021, compared to 100 in 2015. The
												number is approaching the pre-COVID level of 116.2 from December 2019.

												The market size of TV home shopping is considerably larger than in other countries, and this
												also falls under the non-face-to-face retail business.
												TV home shopping, PC-based online shopping, and mobile-based home shopping all grew, offsetting
												the sluggishness of offline retail.
												The growth of mobile online shopping is notable. Compared to January 2020, it recorded sales of
												KRW 10.6 trillion, a 29.2% increase compared to January 2020, and the proportion of mobile in
												online shopping also exceeded 70% according to Statistics Korea.
