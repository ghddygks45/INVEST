                                The Minister of Justice has the authority to issue visas, but the authority may be delegated to heads of diplomatic offices as prescribed by Presidential Decree. Consequently, a foreigner may apply for and obtain a visa from the head of a diplomatic office; arrive in Korea and go through immigration at the airport to obtain a status and period of stay (when holding a short-term visa or when the foreigner is a citizen of a visa waiver country); or may obtain a certificate or number of visa issuance confirmation from the immigration office, submit the certificate to a diplomatic office, and obtain a visa.
