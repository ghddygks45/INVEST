														For example, Silicon Valley-based VC Goodwater Capital is pursuing the establishment of a

														Goodwater Capital was a major early investor in Coupang, Kakao, and Toss and invested KRW

											</div>
											<div class="normal-txt">
												The Venture Investment Promotion Act (hereinafter Venture Investment Act) was enacted in
												February 2020 and has been in effect since July of the same year. The Venture Investment Act
												integrated the venture investment systems that were scattered and created a consistent venture
												investment ecosystem. Regulations were also eased, for example, facilitation of private venture
												capital investment and angel investment by individuals. <br class="pc-content">
												For example, startup planners (accelerators) who discover promising companies, supply initial
												investment, and incubate them are allowed to form venture investment associations (investment
												funds) if certain conditions were met, such as professional manpower and capital. Deregulation
												was implemented by lowering the minimum investment required to establish a fund by KRW 2 billion
												to KRW 3 billion.
											</div>
											<div class="normal-txt">
												The government is promoting a variety of initiatives, including the relaxation of issuance
												requirements, such as grant targets, so that venture companies can issue and utilize stock
												options widely; the promotion of the expansion of global venture funds and overseas VC
												networking that support venture companies' overseas investment and expansion; the introduction
												of a Silicon Valley-style venture fund governance structure to enhance inflow of foreign capital
												and accountability; new technology innovation M&A guarantees to raise funds for company
												acquisitions; and expansion of M&A funds to supply liquidity.
