When an employer hires a fixed-term worker for more than two years, the fixed-term worker is deemed a worker subject to a non-fixed-term employment contract. Employers shall not give discriminatory treatment to fixed-term workers on the grounds of employment status compared with other workers engaged in the same or similar kinds of work on non-fixed-term employment contracts at the business or workplace concerned.
