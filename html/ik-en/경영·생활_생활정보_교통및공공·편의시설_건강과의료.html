                                Under the national health insurance system, every Korean resident is required to pay a certain amount of monthly health insurance contribution depending on their income level and assets.<br>
                                The national health insurance policyholders are categorized into employer-provided and locally-provided policyholders. Workers and employers of all workplaces, public officials, and school employees are employer-provided policyholders.

                                Foreign residents who are registered and work at business where health insurance is applied as well as foreign residents who are appointed or employed as public officials or school employees are granted the status of employer-provided policyholders.<br>
								Foreign residents who are registered but not categorized as an employee-provided policyholder or a dependent may gain the status of locally-provided policyholders.<br>
								Such locally-provided policyholders must maintain the status of sojourn stipulated in Attached Table 9 of the Enforcement Rules of the National Health Insurance Act. Foreign residents who have resided in Korea for at least six months will automatically be granted the qualification for the locally-provided policy. Foreigners who have been residing in Korea for less than six months can also apply for national health insurance coverage if there are reasons to believe the applicant will reside in Korea for at least six months subsequently for study or marriage.

Foreigners are automatically enrolled in the national health insurance once they have resided in Korea for at leasts six months. If a health insurance card has not been yet issued, a foreigner can visit a branch office of the National Health Insurance Service in the area of their residence and submit a copy of an alien registration card and an insurance application. Foreigners may apply for insurance unaccompanied.

                                The Korean medical system separates prescribing and dispensing of medication. Drugs are divided into prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs.

								Products that are not drugs, such as pesticides, sanitary pads, health supplement drinks, and condoms, can be purchased at retail stores, including convenience stores, in addition to pharmacies. Following the recent legislative amendment, some medicines for cold, digestion, fever and pain relief, and pain relief patches can be purchased at convenience stores.
