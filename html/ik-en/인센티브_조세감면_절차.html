                                A foreign investor may request a confirmation of eligibility for tax reductions or exemptions before sending notification of a foreign investment. The confirmation process verifies simply whether the foreign investor’s technology is subject to tax reductions or exemptions, hence, an application for tax reductions or exemptions must be made after notification of the investment.
