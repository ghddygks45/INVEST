                            The patent applicant can identify and respond to any reasons for rejection before the official examination by exchanging opinions based on the results of the preliminary review by examiners, meanwhile examiners can review and grant patent rights in a more accurate and swift manner by exchanging opinions with the applicant regarding the concerned technology and examination itself.

                            Through reviews of multiple applications at one time at a time of their choosing, companies can secure collective intellectual property rights in line with new product releases, etc. in accordance with their business strategies, and the country as a whole can commercialize the outcome of R&D efforts and promote technology transfer.

                            Through this system, patent applicants exchange opinions on revisions through a consultation with examiners before submitting final amendments to their applications in cases of refusal notifications. By doing so, applicants can advance the timing of patent decisions by identifying chances for resolving refusals and thereby reducing unnecessary procedures, while examiners can ensure accurate examinations by exchanging opinions on the technologies and examinations with applicants.

                            The Korea Intellectual Property Office has created a “Cyber Bulletin” to operate an online technology publication service through its website. In many cases, the existing application system forced holders of certain technologies, for which exercising patents was difficult, to apply for additional patents for the purposes of defense, resulting in wastes of time and cost. Thus, when those who have no intention to secure patent rights but still seek protection from the exercise of patent rights of others posts details of their technology on the Cyber Bulletin, the Korea Intellectual Property Office notarizes the contents and date of the technology concerned and recognizes the priority, thereby preventing any disadvantages in business from other companies’ exercising of patent rights.
