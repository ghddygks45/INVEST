                            Under the Labor Standards Act revised in March 2018, companies that employ 300 or more workers can extend their working hours by up to 12 hours per week from July 2018, which brings the maximum weekly working hours up to 52 hours.

From July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022, when an employer who regularly employees fewer than 30 full-time employees enters into a written agreement with the labor representative, the employer may extend working hours up to 8 hours per week, in addition to the working hours extended as detailed above.
