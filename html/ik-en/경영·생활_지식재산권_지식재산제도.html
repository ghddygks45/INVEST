                            While patent rights protect inventions, utility model rights protect designs. Thus, utility model refers to the design itself which improves an existing invention to make it more convenient and useful. The registration system for utility model rights helps determine whether to register a utility model after conducting a substantive examination.

                            <h4 class="sub-tit01">Design Rights</h4>
                            Design rights refer to the exclusive rights enjoyed by the registrant for all designs that create an aesthetic impression through visual aspects such as the form, shape or color of goods, or a combination of those factors. If the applicant wishes to apply for a design similar to the previously applied basic design, the design can be recognized as a related design upon the application within one year from the registration date of the basic design and thereby obtain the design right.

                            <h4 class="sub-tit01">Trademark Rights</h4>
                            Trademark rights refer to the rights to exclusively use the labels that identify a particular product. Labels refer to all markings that are used to indicate the source of a product, regardless of its composition or manner of expression, including symbols, letters, shapes, sounds, smells, stereoscopic features, holograms, actions, or colors. Trademark rights last for ten years from the registration date and an application for renewal is required every ten years.
