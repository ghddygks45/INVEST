                            Korea has a temperate climate with four relatively distinct seasons. Climate change, caused by global warming, has been prolonging summer compared to the other three seasons.<br>
                            In January, the coldest month of the year, the temperature can drop to as low as -17 degrees Celsius, whereas it can reach 39 degrees in August (as of 2018), the hottest month of the year. Humidity rises to 85 percent in summer, notably increasing the heat index. Summer usually begins with a rainy season (known as jangma in Korea), and 50 to 60 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the summer months. <br>
                            Fine and ultrafine dust has increasingly become an issue in Korea, with its concentration being higher from fall to spring and lower in the summer.

                                Central administrative agencies are liable for providing public services for the entire nation. These agencies are headed by the President. The Prime Minister assists the President while supervising ministries. Ministers direct and oversee their ministries while executing matters as prescribed by related laws. Korea’s central administrative agencies consist of eighteen bu (ministries), five cheo (agencies), seventeen cheong (administrations), two won (boards), four sil (offices), and six commissions (total: 52 agencies as of 2019). The National Human Rights Commission, one of the six commissions, is an independent agency.

Local councils are responsible for legislation, amendment and repeal of local ordinances, deliberation and determination of budgets, approval for settlement of accounts, audit and inspection of administrative affairs, and acceptance and handling of petitions, etc. Local governments cover local finances through local tax revenues and non-tax income, including service charges and user fees, local subsidies from the central government, national subsidies, and local taxes.</div>
