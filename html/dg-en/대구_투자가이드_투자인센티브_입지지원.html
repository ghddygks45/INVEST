											The Free Trade Zone is a special area first introduced in Korea in 1970 during the country's industrialization period. It is operated as a customs tariff reserve area, which contributes to improving trades by exempting customs clearance procedures for raw material imported from overseas, and product exports. In the beginning the area was operated mainly as a free export zone centered around manufacturing. However, the free customs zone centered around logistics was added later. In 2004, it was unified as a Free Trade Zone. Free Trade Zones and Foreign Investment Zones give the same benefits to tenant companies in tax reductions, providing factory site leases etc. The biggest difference lies in that the Free Trade Zone was introduced for the purpose of promoting trade, and is operated as a non-tariff area.
										</div>
										<div class="sub-section03">
											<div class="sub-tit04">Comparison with Free Economic Zones</div>
											Free Economic Zones have been introduced to swiftly create a foreigner friendly management·living environment in some areas, as part of the plan to develop Korea to be the business center in Northeast Asia. Free Economic Zones are larger than the basic local governments in scale. The administrative authority is commissioned to the management office to enable self-exercise of administrative authorities, which can provide special treatments in setting up foreign schools and hospitals and other measures in creating a foreigner oriented environment. In such ways, the Free Economic Zones are different from foreign invested areas.
