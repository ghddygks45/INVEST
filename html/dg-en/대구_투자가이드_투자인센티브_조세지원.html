                                        <li>The application deadline for new corporations is the end of the taxation year which the business commencement day of the foreign investment company belongs to for new corporations. For capital increase corporations, the deadline will be determined according to the new investment tax reduction regulations of the Tax Exemptions and Exceptions Act (Paragraph 2, Article 121 & Paragraph 3, Article 121). However, if foreign-invested companies increase capital within the range of the notified amount of foreign investment confirmed at the time of determining tax reduction within 3 years of the initial tax reduction notice day after the foreign investment notification, the increased portion shall receive tax reduction without having to apply for reductions (applied to the initial portion of capital increase since January 1st, 2006). Also, when changing the business subject to tax reduction, and wishing to receive reduction to the changed business, it shall be done within 2 years after the date of the cause for change (reductions will only apply to the remaining period in such cases). If reduction applications are made and accepted for tax reduction after the tax reduction application deadline has passed, reductions will be granted to the taxation year of the reduction application date. However, tax already paid shall not be refunded.</li>

Simple changes in the corporate name or the location are not subject to tax reduction change application, and hence shall be notified to the district tax office or the local government.
